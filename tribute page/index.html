                    <p>
                        Sindhutai was born on November 14, 1947, in ‘Pimpri Meghe’ in Maharashtra’s Wardha district. Abhimaan Sathe was his father’s name, and he was a caravan (grazing animal). Sindhutai was called ‘Chindi’ (a torn piece of cloth) because everyone disliked her (because she was a daughter and not a son). On the other hand, his father wanted to teach Sindhu, so he used to send Indus to school against Indus’ mother’s wishes. Sindhu’s education was disrupted due to her mother’s opposition and the family’s economic circumstances. She had to drop out of school after passing the fourth-grade exam due to financial constraints, home responsibilities, and child marriage.
